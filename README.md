# EDKG-DL: An Interpretabile Endocrine Disruption Knowledge Graph-Augmented Deep Learning Model for Rapid and Accurate Prediction of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals

This repository is the official implementation of **EDKG-DL**, proposed in our unpublished manuscript:  
[**Toward Sustainable Screening of Multi-Endpoint Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals via a Causality-Integrated Knowledge Graph Deep Learning Framework**].  
The paper has been submitted and is currently under peer review.

🔑 **Keywords**: endocrine disruption, knowledge graph, deep learning, causality, toxicity prediction

# 💖 Brief introduction
We propose an **D**eep **L**earning framework with causality-integrated **E**ndocrine **D**isruption **K**nowledge **G**raph (**EDKG-DL**), designed to enable efficient, interpretable, and sustainable screening of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs).  
This repository provides the **core code and modeling data** used in our unpublished manuscript (currently under peer review). For the **complete model**, including the endocrine disruption knowledge graph, toxicology datasets, and interactive prediction platform, please visit 👉 [https://www.edkgdl.com/#/](https://www.edkgdl.com/#/).

## 🤖 Model

1. **Graph-informed data preparation**  
   Assay outcomes from 26 in vitro and in vivo tests are mapped onto EDKG biological elements, generating two toxicity-informed graph representations:  
   - a **qualitative graph** (74 elements with binary annotations), and  
   - a **quantitative graph** (52 elements with potency values, including (Q)SAR-based predictions).  

2. **Qualitative EDKG-guided classification**  
   The qualitative graph is embedded into a three-layer edge-based **graph convolutional network (GCN)**. This module captures mechanistic interactions to predict whether a compound exhibits overall endocrine-disrupting potential, outputting a binary EDC/non-EDC label.  

3. **Quantitative EDKG-guided prioritization**  
   For compounds classified as EDCs, the quantitative graph is used to estimate **adverse outcome (AO)-specific potency** and predict **NOAEL** values. By tracing upstream causal pathways, this module identifies the most sensitive AO and its mechanistic drivers, supporting evidence-based prioritization and risk assessment.

### 📑 Data schema (per compound folder)

Each compound folder (e.g., `0/`) contains two files describing its EDKG subset:

---

#### `Graph_index.txt`  
Two columns (whitespace or tab-delimited):

1. **node_id** *(int)*: node index in the EDKG  
2. **activated** *(int)*: node activation label  
   - `1` = activated  
   - `0` = not activated  

**Example**  
```
0 1
1 0
2 1
```
#### `Graph_edge_index_direct.txt`  

Four columns (whitespace or tab-delimited):

1. **src** *(int)*: source node id  
2. **dst** *(int)*: target node id  
3. **edge_attr** *(float)*: edge activation attribute  
   - both nodes activated → `1`  
   - exactly one node activated → `0.5`  
   - neither node activated → `0`  
4. **confidence** *(float)*: confidence score (larger = higher confidence)  

**Example**  
```
49 21 0 3
17 49 0 5
17 37 0 5
```


# 📝 Note
All training data were generated by first converting **SMILES strings** into **molecular descriptors/fingerprints**.  
The conversion was performed using **PaDEL-Descriptor**, which can be downloaded from:
